## 🚀 **Next Steps - Push to GitHub**

### Option 1: Push All Branches at Once
```bash
# Push all feature branches to GitHub
git push --all origin

# Then create Pull Requests in GitHub UI
```

### Option 2: Push Individual Branches
```bash
# Push one branch at a time
git push origin feature/docker-setup
git push origin feature/kubernetes-manifests
git push origin feature/github-actions-cicd
git push origin feature/development-scripts
git push origin feature/build-tools-config
git push origin feature/code-quality-fixes
git push origin feature/comprehensive-documentation
```

### Option 3: Merge Locally First
```bash
# Switch to main and merge branches
git checkout main

# Merge in logical order
git merge feature/docker-setup
git merge feature/kubernetes-manifests
git merge feature/github-actions-cicd
git merge feature/development-scripts
git merge feature/build-tools-config
git merge feature/code-quality-fixes
git merge feature/comprehensive-documentation

# Then push main
git push origin main
```
